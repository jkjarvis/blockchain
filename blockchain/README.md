Blockchain

This project is a simple implementation of creating a blockchain using python. This is an example of a general purpose blockchain. The base concept uses OOPS and creates an instance of the blockchain class and has methods defined.

We are using flask to serve the API to the client where they can execute 2 methods i.e mine_block: to mine a block OR get_chain: to get the total chain

To run : `python blockchain.py`
